#SWAG LIST
=========

Swag List is a location based concert/ event tracking web application. 

##Overview

Swag List provides a simple, minimal and elegant interface and user experience to find and track concerts/ events at any given location.


##Motivation

Most of the concert/ event websites out there are not built with careful design considerations. It is usually overly simplistic or bulky with ads and complicated to get around. Swag List counters typical concert/ event tracking sites by giving the users a site that is simple to use and aesthetically pleasing.

##Built With

* Node.js
* Express
* Bands In Town API
* Map Box API
* Passport
* Sequelize
* Bootstrap
